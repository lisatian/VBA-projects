"customer orders.xlsm" is a VBA module in Excel that prompts the spreadsheet user to enter a numerical amount for total dollars spent, then searches the worksheet of customer orders to sift out the customers whose total spending is greater than the amount given. These customer accounts get displayed on a new worksheet called Report, which shows the customer ID and their respective spending in table format.

Note: If the same customer has multiple spending entries, this automation can total the customer's spending before comparing it to the user input benchmark.
Can also:
- perform user input validation
- sort the worksheet of customer orders based on attributes such as date and ID.
