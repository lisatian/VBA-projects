"customer orders.xlsm" is a VBA module in Excel that helps the spreadsheet user search for customers who spent more than any given amount.

There is a button on the spreadsheet that, once clicked, will prompt the spreadsheet user to enter a numerical amount for total dollars spent, then searches the worksheet of customer orders to sift out the customers whose total spending is greater than that amount. These customer accounts get displayed on a new worksheet called Report, where the customer ID and their respective spending are shown in table format.

Note: If the same customer has multiple spending entries, this automation can sum the customer's total spending before comparing it to the user input benchmark.


Can also:
- perform user input validation
- sort the worksheet of customer orders based on attributes such as date and ID.
